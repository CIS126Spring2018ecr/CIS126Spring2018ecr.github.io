        		<h1>Hello, and welcome! I'm Emily.</h1>
				<p>As you can see, I'm very creative, and would never dream of only modifying the text sections of this code. Especially not because of laziness. <a href="#">Read more about my amazing dedication to not being lazy...</a></p>
			<h4>What is Git?</h4>
				<p>Git is a tool. It is repositories for open source software development, on a large scope.</p>
			<h4>Who started Git?</h4>
				<p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds. The development began on April 3rd, 2005. It became self-hosting by April 7th.</p>
			<h4>What is Hub?</h4>
				<p>A Hub is a center of the network. For GitHub, it is what connects everyone. However, within GitHub there are certain commands. One is "git". "Hub" can be used to enchange the "git" commands.</p>
			<h4>Describe Repository and its role?</h4>
				<p>Repository is the digital directory. It is the storage space where the projects and code is saved and uploaded. Its role is to hold all the files, and all versions of those files (which includes the revision history).</p>
			<h4>Your thoughts about GitHub.</h4>
				<p>I have never heard of Github, and this is the first time I am seeing anything from it. On one hand, the idea of other people being able to see my code is kind of terrifying. On the other, I feel like this is an amazing opportunity. I can see it being very helpful, and I see why this could be a very useful resource. I am excited to learn more about it and how to properly use it.</p>
